Sub-folder structure is based on the following

1 - Categorized based on Iteration 2 (NOT Iteration 2 (Assets)!) Figma page categorization, if involved in mutliple different places, put under "common"
2 - Categorized based on types such as text, card, list, form or screens
3 - From here on, the categorization is not necessary, full freedom on how you wanted to put it

What should be here
- Widgets
- Ephemeral States for Stateful Widgets
